# Study
ðŸš€ Just built a simple productivity web app called Study Buddy using HTML, CSS & JavaScript!

ðŸ“š It includes:
âœ… A To-Do List to track daily study goals
âœ… A Motivational Quote Generator with inspiring messages
âœ… (Coming soon) Pomodoro Timer & Progress Tracker

ðŸ’¡ This was a small but exciting project to improve my JavaScript and DOM manipulation skills.
âœ¨ No external APIs â€” quotes are randomly shown from a list of handpicked motivational lines!

ðŸ”§ Tools Used:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
